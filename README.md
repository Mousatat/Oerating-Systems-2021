# Operating-Systems-2021

This repository for operating System course which include labs and exams from Innopolis university bachelor degree second year Data science Fall semester 2021

This course covers the following concepts: 

Structure of an operating system; Specific mechanisms, policies, and algorithms used to implement the different parts of an operating system.

the main purpose of this course:

Operating systems are the core part of a computing device and computing devices are an integral part of our life, not only as programmers, but also just as human being â€“ it is enough to think at smart homes infrastructures, now available at accessible prices to everyone, at car devices, like smart navigator and cruise control systems, at other infrastructures. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the structure of an operating systems has a paramount role in the curriculum of a student in computer science and engineering. The purpose of this course is to provide such understanding. This is a core course, so it is not among its goals to explore the details of the various proposal for operating systems that are now emerging: this is the subject of more advanced endeavours.
