*Recovery: recovery is useful if it can be used to either terminate a process or preempt its resources.
However, it is not permitted to be used in RT or batch systems.

*Prevention: If requests from processes are granted, this is the optimal technique.
Furthermore, the difficulty of planning is solvable.

*Avoiding deadlocks is beneficial when fresh requests for resources necessitate dynamic judgments. Banker's algorithm is commonly employed for this strategy.
This method is suitable for interactive systems.
